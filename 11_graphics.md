Meshes
------

In case you used the internal mesher `xmeshfem3D` to create and partition your mesh, you can output mesh files in ABAQUS (.INP) and DX (.dx) format to visualize them. For this, you must set either the flag `CREATE_DX_FILES` or `CREATE_ABAQUS_FILES` to `.true.` in the mesher’s parameter file `Mesh_Par_file` prior to running the mesher (see Chapter [cha:Running-the-Mesher-Meshfem3D] for details). You can then use AVS or OpenDX to visualize the mesh and MPI partition (slices).

You have also the option to visualize the distributed databases produced by `xgenerate_databases` using Paraview . For this, you must set the flag `SAVE_MESH_FILES` to `.true.` in the main parameter file `Par_file` (see Chapter [cha:Main-Parameter] for details). This will create VTK files for each single partition. You can then use Paraview to visualized these partitions.

<span>*T*o visualize seismograms with Paraview, you should turn off the flag SU\_FORMAT, and turn on the use binary seismograms flag. This will generate .bin files, that you can open with Paraview. You have to select the way you open it (“raw”), and specify the dimensions of the file (NSTEP and NREC).</span>

Movies
------

To make a surface or volume movie of the simulation, set parameters `MOVIE_SURFACE`, `MOVIE_VOLUME`, `MOVIE_TYPE`, and `NTSTEP_BETWEEN_FRAMES` in the `Par_file`. Turning on the movie flags, in particular `MOVIE_VOLUME`, produces large output files. `MOVIE_VOLUME` files are saved in the `LOCAL_PATH` directory, whereas `MOVIE_SURFACE` output files are saved in the `OUTPUT_FILES` directory. We save the displacement field if the parameter `SAVE_DISPLACEMENT` is set, otherwise the velocity field is saved. The look of a movie is determined by the half-duration of the source. The half-duration should be large enough so that the movie does not contain frequencies that are not resolved by the mesh, i.e., it should not contain numerical noise. This can be accomplished by selecting a CMT `HALF_DURATION` \> 1.1 \(\times\) smallest period (see figure [fig:CMTSOLUTION-file]). When `MOVIE_SURFACE` = .`true.`, the half duration of each source in the `CMTSOLUTION` file is replaced by

> \[\sqrt{(}\mathrm{\mathtt{HALF\_DURATIO}\mathtt{N}^{2}}+\mathrm{\mathtt{HDUR\_MOVI}\mathtt{E}^{2}})\]

**NOTE:** If `HDUR_MOVIE` is set to 0.0, the code will select the appropriate value of 1.1 \(\times\) smallest period. As usual, for a point source one can set `half duration` in the `CMTSOLUTION` file to be 0.0 and `HDUR_MOVIE` = 0.0 in the `Par_file` to get the highest frequencies resolved by the simulation, but for a finite source one would keep all the `half durations` as prescribed by the finite source model and set `HDUR_MOVIE` = 0.0.

### Movie Surface and Shakemaps

When running `xspecfem3D` with the `MOVIE_SURFACE` flag turned on, the code outputs `moviedata??????` files in the `OUTPUT_FILES` directory. There are several flags in the main parameter file `Par_file` that control the output of these movie data files, please see section [cha:Main-Parameter] for more details. Especially, the following parameters affect the output:

-   `SAVE_DISPLACEMENT`: to save displacement instead of velocity,

-   `NTSTEP_BETWEEN_FRAMES`: to set the timesteps between frames,

-   `USE_HIGHRES_FOR_MOVIES`: to save values at all GLL point instead of element edges.

You can also output shakemaps independant of the `MOVIE_SURFACE` flag. Shakemaps show the peak-ground values of the simulation. For creating shakemaps (at the end of the simulation), you would set the parameter `CREATE_SHAKEMAP` to `.true.`. For shakemaps, both the parameters `MOVIE_TYPE` and `USE_HIGHRES_FOR_MOVIES` affect the output. The following setting has an additional affect:

-   `MOVIE_TYPE`: if set to \(1\), the horizontal peak-ground values of displacement/velocity/acceleration are output. if set to \(2\), the maximum length of the particle displacement/velocity/acceleration vector is output. Please be aware that these peak-ground values can differ from each other.

The movie and shakemap output files are in a custom binary format, but there is a program provided to convert the output into more user friendly formats:

<span>`xcreate_movie_shakemap_AVS_DX_GMT`</span>  
From `create_movie_shakemap_AVS_DX_GMT.f90`, it outputs data in ASCII, OpenDX, or AVS format (also readable in ParaView). Before compiling the code, make sure you have the file `surface_from_mesher.h` in the `OUTPUT_FILES/` directory. This file will be created by the solver run. Then type

    make xcreate_movie_shakemap_AVS_DX_GMT

and run the executable `xcreate_movie_shakemap_AVS_DX_GMT` in the main directory. It will create visualization files in your format of choice. The code will prompt the user for input parameters.

The `SPECFEM3D Cartesian` code is running in near real-time to produce animations of southern California earthquakes via the web; see Southern California ShakeMovie.

### Movie Volume

When running xspecfem3D with the `MOVIE_VOLUME` flag turned on, the code outputs several files in `LOCAL_PATH` specified in the main `Par_file`, e.g. in directory `OUTPUT_FILES/DATABASES_MPI`. The output is saved by each processor at the time interval specified by `NTSTEP_BETWEEN_FRAMES`. For all domains, the velocity field is output to files:

    proc??????_velocity_X_it??????.bin
    proc??????_velocity_Y_it??????.bin
    proc??????_velocity_Z_it??????.bin

For elastic domains, the divergence and curl taken from the velocity field, i.e. \(\nabla\cdot{\bf {v}}\) and \(\nabla\times{\bf {v}}\), get stored as well:

    proc??????_div_it??????.bin
    proc??????_curl_X_t??????.bin
    proc??????_curl_Y_it??????.bin
    proc??????_curl_Z_it??????.bin

The files denoted `proc??????_div_glob_it??????.bin` and `proc??????_curl_glob_it??????.bin` are stored on the global points only, all the other arrays are stored on all GLL points. Note that the components X/Y/Z can change to E/N/Z according to the `SUPPRESS_UTM_PROJECTION` flag (see also Appendix [cha:Coordinates] and [cha:channel-codes]).

<div class="figcaption" style="text-align:justify;font-size:80%"><span style="color:#9A9A9A">Figure: Paraview visualization using movie volume files (converted by `xcombine_vol_data` and `mesh2vtu.pl`) and showing snapshots of vertical velocity components at different times.<span data-label="fig:movie.volume"></span></span></div>

To visualize these files, we use an auxiliary program `combine_vol_data.f90` to combine the data from all slices into one mesh file. To compile it in the root directory, type:

    make xcombine_vol_data

which will create the executable `bin/xcombine_vol_data`. To output the usage of this executable, type

    ./bin/xcombine_vol_data

without arguments.

`xcombine_vol_data` will combine the data on the different processors (located in `OUTPUT_FILES/DATABASES_MPI`), for a given quantity and a given iteration, to one file. For example, if you want to combine `velocity_Z`, for the iteration 400 on 4 processors, i.e. if you want to combine these files :

    proc000000_velocity_Z_it000400.bin
    proc000001_velocity_Z_it000400.bin
    proc000002_velocity_Z_it000400.bin
    proc000003_velocity_Z_it000400.bin

You have to go in the directory of the concerned example (where are the directories `DATA`, `OUTPUT_FILES`, etc.). Then, you can launch `xcombine_vol_data`, specifying the path where it is located. As an example, if the `DATA` and `OUTPUT_FILES` directories of the concerned example are in the root specfem3d directory, `xcombine_vol_data` is in `./bin`, and you have to type:

    ./bin/xcombine_vol_data 0 3 velocity_Z_it000400 ./OUTPUT_FILES/DATABASES_MPI ./OUTPUT_FILES 0

Here, \(0\) is the number of the first processor, \(3\) the number of the last one, `velocity_Z_it000400` the name of the files we want to combine without the prefix `proc000000*_`, `./OUTPUT_FILES/DATABASES_MPI` the directory where the files are located, `./OUTPUT_FILES` the directory where the combined file will be stored, and \(0\) is the parameter to create a low-resolution mesh file (\(1\) for a high-resolution).

When compiling the code, you will get two executables related to this: xcombine\_vol\_data, and xcombine\_vol\_data\_vtk. Use the executable that has the \_vtk extension if you want to directly create VTK files. If you use the executable that does not have the \_vtk extension, then the output mesh file will have a name of the form `velocity_Z_it000400.mesh`. You will then have to convert the `.mesh` file into the VTU (Unstructured grid file) format which can be viewed in ParaView.

For this task, you can use and modify the script `mesh2vtu.pl` located in directory `utils/Visualization/Paraview`, for example:

    mesh2vtu.pl -i velocity_Z_it000400.mesh -o velocity_Z_it000400.vtu

Notice that this Perl script uses a program `mesh2vtu` in the `utils/Visualization/Paraview/mesh2vtu` directory, which further uses the VTK run-time library for its execution. Therefore, make sure you have them properly set in the script according to your system.

Then, to do a movie with several iterations, you have to repeat this process for each iteration you want to put in your movie.

Finite-Frequency Kernels
------------------------

The finite-frequency kernels computed as explained in Section [sec:Adjoint-simulation-finite] are saved in the `LOCAL_PATH` at the end of the simulation. Therefore, we first need to collect these files on the front end, combine them into one mesh file, and visualize them with some auxiliary programs.

1.  **Create slice files**

    We will only discuss the case of one source-receiver pair, i.e., the so-called banana-doughnut kernels. Although it is possible to collect the kernel files from all slices on the front end, it usually takes up too much storage space (at least tens of gigabytes). Since the sensitivity kernels are the strongest along the source-receiver great circle path, it is sufficient to collect only the slices that are along or close to the great circle path.

    A Perl script `slice_number.pl` located in directory `utils/Visualization/Paraview/` can help to figure out the slice numbers that lie along the great circle path. It applies to meshes created with the internal mesher `xmeshfem3D`.

    1.  On machines where you have access to the script, copy the `Mesh_Par_file`, and `output_solver` files, and run:

            slice_number.pl Mesh_Par_file output_solver.txt slice_file

        which will generate a `slices_file`.

    2.  For cases with multiple sources and multiple receivers, you need to provide a slice file before proceeding to the next step.

2.  **Collect the kernel files**

    After obtaining the slice files, you can collect the corresponding kernel files from the given slices.

    1.  You can use or modify the script `utils/copy_basin_database.pl` to accomplish this:

            utils/copy_database.pl slice_file lsf_machine_file filename [jobid]

        where `lsf_machine_file`<span> is the machine file generated by the LSF scheduler, </span>`filename`<span> is the kernel name (e.g., </span>`rho_kernel`<span>, </span>`alpha_kernel`<span> and </span>`beta_kernel`<span>), and the optional </span>`jobid`<span> is the name of the subdirectory under </span>`LOCAL_PATH`<span> where all the kernel files are stored.</span>

    2.  After executing this script, all the necessary mesh topology files as well as the kernel array files are collected to the local directory of the front end.

3.  **Combine kernel files into one mesh file**

    We use an auxiliary program `combine_vol_data.f90` to combine the kernel files from all slices into one mesh file.

    1.  Compile it in the root directory:

            make xcombine_vol_data
            ./bin/xcombine_vol_data slice_list filename input_dir output_dir high/low-resolution

        where `input_dir` is the directory where all the individual kernel files are stored, and `output_dir` is where the mesh file will be written.

    2.  Use 1 for a high-resolution mesh, outputting all the GLL points to the mesh file, or use 0 for low resolution, outputting only the corner points of the elements to the mesh file.

    3.  The output mesh file will have the name `filename_rho(alpha,beta).mesh`

4.  **Convert mesh files into .vtu files**

    1.  We next convert the `.mesh` file into the VTU (Unstructured grid file) format which can be viewed in ParaView. For this task, you can use and modify the script `mesh2vtu.pl` located in directory `utils/Visualization/Paraview/`, for example:

            mesh2vtu.pl -i file.mesh -o file.vtu

    2.  Notice that this Perl script uses a program `mesh2vtu` in the `utils/Visualization/Paraview/mesh2vtu` directory, which further uses the VTK run-time library for its execution. Therefore, make sure you have them properly set in the script according to your system.

5.  **Copy over the source and receiver .vtk file**

    In the case of a single source and a single receiver, the simulation also generates the file `sr.vtk` located in the `OUTPUT_FILES/` directory to describe the source and receiver locations, which can also be viewed in Paraview in the next step.

6.  **View the mesh in ParaView**

    Finally, we can view the mesh in ParaView .

    1.  Open ParaView.

    2.  From the top menu, \(\rightarrow\), select `file.vtu`, and click the button.

        -   If the mesh file is of moderate size, it shows up on the screen; otherwise, only the bounding box is shown.

    3.  Click \(\rightarrow\) \(\rightarrow\) and select to display it.

    4.  To create a cross-section of the volumetric mesh, choose \(\rightarrow\) , and under , choose \(\rightarrow\) .

    5.  Fill in center and normal information given by the `global_slice_number.pl` script (either from the standard output or from `normal_plane.txt` file).

    6.  To change the color scale, go to \(\rightarrow\) \(\rightarrow\) and reselect lower and upper limits, or change the color scheme.

    7.  Now load in the source and receiver location file by \(\rightarrow\) , select `sr.vt`k, and click the button. Choose \(\rightarrow\) , and represent the points by ‘’.

    8.  For more information about ParaView, see the ParaView Users Guide .
