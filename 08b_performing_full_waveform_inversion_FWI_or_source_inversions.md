Performing full waveform inversion (FWI) or source inversions
=============================================================

*ANNOUNCEMENT: SPECFEM3D can now perform full waveform inversion (FWI), i.e. invert for models in an iterative fashion, and it can also perform source inversions in a constant model; please refer to the two new directories, `inverse_problem_for_model` and `inverse_problem_for_source`, and the README files they contain. For FWI inversions for the model, also refer to the new examples provided in directory `EXAMPLES`.*
